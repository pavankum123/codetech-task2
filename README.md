## Overview of the Project


### Project: TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY MONITORING WITH DHT SENSOR
![image alt]()

### Objective
The objective of a Temperature and Humidity Monitoring System using a DHT sensor is to measure and display the environmental temperature and humidity levels. This can be used for various applications, such as in weather stations, HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) systems, agriculture (to monitor greenhouse conditions), and other smart home or industrial systems.
The primary objective is to accurately measure the temperature and humidity of the surrounding environment using the DHT sensor (e.g., DHT11 or DHT22).

### Key Activities
**Sensor Selection and Setup**: Choose the appropriate DHT sensor (e.g., DHT11 or DHT22) based on accuracy, temperature range, and humidity range requirements.
**Wiring the Circuit**: Connect the DHT sensor to the Arduino board following the correct pin configuration (VCC, GND, and DATA pin)
**Installing Required Libraries**: Install necessary libraries for the DHT sensor (e.g., DHT sensor library by Adafruit) and for the LCD display (e.g., LiquidCrystal library).
**Reading Data from the DHT Sensor**: Use the Arduino code to read the temperature and humidity data from the sensor.

### Technologies Used
**DHT Sensor (DHT11 or DHT22)**: A temperature and humidity sensor that measures both environmental temperature and relative humidity.
**Arduino (Microcontroller)**: Arduino Uno or other compatible Arduino boards are used as the central processing unit for reading sensor data, processing it, and displaying it either on an LCD or Serial Monitor.
**Arduino IDE**: The Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is used to write, compile, and upload code to the Arduino board.
**LiquidCrystal Library**: The LiquidCrystal library is used to interface with a 16x2 LCD display to show the temperature and humidity readings.
